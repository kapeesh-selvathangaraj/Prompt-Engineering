# 🧠 Prompt Engineering

Welcome to my **Prompt Engineering Learning Journal**!  
This repository is a daily log of what I’ve learned about designing better prompts for large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, and Gemini. It’s structured to show clear, incremental learning — one day at a time.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo serves as a **"Proof of Learning"** — a public showcase of my progress in mastering prompt engineering techniques and strategies.

By the end of this journey, I aim to:
- Understand and apply core prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT, etc.)
- Design domain-specific prompts for coding, writing, reasoning, and analysis
- Evaluate and compare prompt effectiveness
- Build mini-projects based on prompt-driven applications

## 💡 Why Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the **interface layer** between humans and powerful AI systems. A well-crafted prompt can:
- Enhance accuracy
- Induce reasoning
- Control tone and style
- Improve safety and robustness

Mastering prompt design is an essential skill for anyone working with AI, from developers to researchers to product designers.
